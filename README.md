# swarm-gcp

Automating Docker Swarm cluster operations with Terraform GCP provider.

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stefanprodan/swarm-gcp.git
$ cd swarm-gcp
$ terraform init
```

Before running the project you'll have to create a GCP service account key. 
Go to _Google Cloud Platform -> API Manager -> Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Service account key_ and 
chose JSON as key type. Rename the file to `account.json` and put it in the project root next to `main.tf`.
Add your SSH key under _Compute Engine -> Metadata -> SSH Keys_.

### Usage

Create a Docker Swarm cluster with three managers and three workers:

```bash
# create a workspace
terraform workspace new swarm

terraform apply \
-var project=my-swarm-proj \
-var manager_instance_count=3 \
-var manager_machine_type=n1-standard-1 \
-var manager_disk_size=50 \
-var worker_instance_count=3 \
-var worker_machine_type=n1-standard-2 \
-var worker_disk_size=50 \
-var docker_version=17.06.2~ce-0~ubuntu \
-var management_ip_range=35.198.189.7
```

This will do the following:

* creates a dedicated network and a firewall rule to allow internal traffic between swarm nodes
* reserves a public IP for each manager node
* provisions 6 VMs with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and a 50GB boot disk
* starts the manager nodes and installs Docker CE and the Stackdrive logging agent via SSH
* customizes the Docker daemon systemd config by enabling the experimental features and the metrics endpoint
* initializes the first manager node as the Docker Swarm leader and extracts the join tokens
* starts the worker nodes in parallel and setups Docker CE the same as on the manager node
* joins the worker nodes in the cluster using the manager node private IP
* creates a firewall rule to allow HTTP/S inbound traffic on all nodes
* allows traffic to the Docker remote API only from the IP specified with `management_ip_range`

The naming convention for a swarm node is in `<WORKSPACE>-<ROLE>-<INDEX>` format, 
running the project on workspace swarm will create 6 nodes distributed across three zones: 

![vms](https://github.com/stefanprodan/swarm-gcp/blob/master/screens/gcp-vms.png)


If you don't create a workspace then you'll be running on the default one and your nods prefix will be `default`. 
You can have multiple workspaces, each with it's own state, so you can run in parallel different Docker Swarm clusters.

With these environment variables you can change the region and zones:

```bash
TF_VAR_region=us-central1
TF_VAR_zones='["us-central1-b", "us-central1-c", "us-central1-f"]'
```

After applying the Terraform plan you'll see several output variables like the public IPs of 
each node and the current workspace. 
You can use the manager public IP variable to connect to the Docker remote API 
and run docker swarm commands.

```bash
$ export DOCKER_HOST=$(terraform output swarm_manager_ip)

$ docker node ls

ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
4c1wrv1fw78qo81h98ox1soij *   swarm-manager-1     Ready               Active              Leader
4c1wrv1fw78qo81h98ox1soij     swarm-manager-2     Ready               Active              Reachable
axxu7bhhtn96pz7cu1udlhub0     swarm-manager-3     Ready               Active              Reachable
lqpdwnum0lt8rr0w2u6enudu7     swarm-worker-1      Ready               Active
mhjb760b7a11d0fdqi48tdit4     swarm-worker-2      Ready               Active
yv27bmn1wfrpy7wuvl603z07i     swarm-worker-3      Ready               Active
```

The VMs logs are shipped to Stackdrive by the google-fluentd agent. 
If you want to query Stackdrive for Docker engine demon errors and warnings you can use this filter:

```bash
resource.type:"gce_instance"
textPayload:"dockerd"
NOT textPayload:"level=info"
```

You can tear down the whole infrastructure with:

 ```bash
terraform destroy -force
```

### Scaling

You can scale up or down the Docker Swarm cluster by modifying the `worker_instance_count`. 
On scale up, all new nodes will join the current cluster. 
When you scale down the workers, Terraform will first drain the node 
and remove it from the swarm before destroying the resources.

```bash
# create the cluster with 2 workers
terraform apply \
-var project=my-swarm-proj \
-var worker_instance_count=2 

# add one worker
terraform apply \
-var project=my-swarm-proj \
-var worker_instance_count=3

# remove two workers
terraform apply \
-var project=my-swarm-proj \
-var worker_instance_count=1
```

The same scaling operations can be applied to manager nodes using the `manager_instance_count` variable, 
always use an odd number of manager.

```bash
# add two managers
terraform apply \
-var project=my-swarm-proj \
-var manager_instance_count=5
```

When removing a manager, Terraform will execute `docker swarm leave --force` before destroying the resource, 
this could break the cluster if there aren't enough managers left to maintain a quorum. 

### Weave Scope setup

Now that you have a Docker Swarm cluster up and running you can start monitoring it with Weave Scope. 
You'll need a Weave Could service token, if you don't have a Weave token go 
to [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works/) and sign up for a Weave Cloud account. 

In order to visualize the Swarm cluster with Weave Cloud you have to deploy the Weave Scope container 
on each Swarm node. Scope needs to run with privileged mode and because Swarm services don't support 
privileged mode you'll have to use a one-shot service that will provision each node with a Scope container.

```bash
docker service create --name scope-launcher --mode global --detach \
    --restart-condition none \
    --mount type=bind,src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock \
    weaveworks/scope-swarm-launcher \
    scope launch --service-token=<WEAVE-CLOUD-TOKEN>
```

The launcher will install Scope on each server and will exit. Using `--restart-condition none` we 
instruct Docker Swarm not to restart the service after it exits. With `--mode global` we make sure 
Scope will be automatically deployed on new servers as you add them to the swarm. 

Once the Scope containers are running on all hosts you can login into Weave Cloud and inspect your cluster.

![Scope Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/swarmprom/master/grafana/screens/weave-scope-hosts-v2.png)

Scope offers remote access to the Swarmâ€™s nods and containers, making it easy to diagnose issues in real-time. 
You can view metrics and metadata of the running processes, tasks, services, stacks and networks. 

### OpenFaaS setup

[OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker which has 
first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a 
range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

Deploy OpenFaaS instrumented with Weave Cloud:

```bash
$ export DOCKER_HOST=$(terraform output swarm_manager_ip)
$ cd openfaas
$ WEAVE_TOKEN=<WEAVE-CLOUD-TOKEN> docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml faas

Creating network faas_net
Creating service faas_prometheus
Creating service faas_alertmanager
Creating service faas_echoit
Creating service faas_gateway
```

Check if OpenFaaS is working by accessing `http://<SWARM-PUBLIC-IP>`. 
Now that you have OpenFaaS running let's run a load test to see the auto scaling in action.

You can run the load test using rakyll/hey or Apache bench.

```bash
#install hey
go get -u github.com/rakyll/hey

#do 10K requests 
hey -n 10000 -c 2 -m POST -d "test" http://<SWARM-PUBLIC-IP>/function/faas_echoit
```

In the Weave Cloud UI under Explore you'll see how OpenFaaS scales up the echoit service:
